-- Try out different data structures (even try an Array!)
  -- HashMap / HashSet helps slightly
  -- Still to try: RBMap and Array
-- Cache hashes?  -- Seems not to help!
-- Cache GCD   -- Only tried in conjunction with hashes

-- Skip unused normalize/positivize steps -- DONE
-- Cache `maxVar` -- DONE
-- Reuse variable slots??  -- Not a good idea, means we can't reuse partially solved problems.

-- Precompute FM data
-- Precompute just enough to choose the target variable for FM
-- Don't actually prepare the FM data until the variable has been chosen
-- A deduplicating cache for constructing the proof
-- Reuse output when case splitting
-- More general mechanism for case splitting
-- Precompute data required for `selectEquality`
-- Easier to type check proofs??
-- Avoid metavariables?
-- Use `AssocList` or `HashMap` for coefficients?
-- Precompute target equality
